/*
Program a text field (an <input type="text"> tag) that letters cannot be typed into. Only numbers are allowed.
*/


/*
Extend a text field so that when the user types, a list of suggested values is shown below the field. You have an array of possible values available and should show those that start with the text that was typed. When a suggestion is clicked, replace the text fieldâ€™s current value with it.

<input type="text" id="field">
<div id="suggestions" style="cursor: pointer"></div>

<script>
  // Builds up an array with global variable names, like
  // 'alert', 'document', and 'scrollTo'
  var terms = [];
  for (var name in window)
    terms.push(name);

  // Your code here.
</script>
